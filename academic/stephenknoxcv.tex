%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt 
\documentclass[11pt]{article} 

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page
\reversemarginpar

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.
%

%% Use these lines for letter-sized paper
\usepackage[paper=letterpaper,

%            margin=25mm,              % 25mm margins
%            includemp]{geometry}

%% More layout: Get rid of indenting throughout entire document
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}

%% This gives us fun enumeration environments. compactitem will be nice.
\usepackage{paralist}

%% Reference the last page in the page number
%
% NOTE: comment the +LP line and uncomment the -LP line to have page
%       numbers without the ``of ##'' last page reference)
%
% NOTE: uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} line to get rid of all page
%       numbers (make sure includefoot is commented out above)
%
\usepackage{fancyhdr,lastpage}
\pagestyle{fancy}
%\pagestyle{empty}      % Uncomment this to get rid of page numbers

meaning a high standard of coding, testing and support was required.
Supported these products in production environment. Also heavily involved in developing the back-end
administration for these websites. Worked extensively with web technologies such
as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript including jQuery, Oracle and Python.

Responsibilities included prototyping, developing and deploying products
to test and live environment. Dealt extensively with clients both during
development and testing process.\\

\textbf{Consultency 2008 -- 2009}: Recipient of an Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher
\footnote{http://www.innovationvouchers.ie/}, which allows small companies to
avail of Irish research facilities. Performed a feasibility study of the
application of ontologies in their software model.\\

Java consultancy for UCD Sport Science department. Worked on
improving an existing posture monitoring system. Integrated robust bluetooth 
connectivity protocols, improved data processing algorithms and
improved the viewer panel.
