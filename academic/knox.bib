@inproceedings{Clear2006Integrating,
	Abstract = {There is a commonly accepted need for contexts and ontologies to describe
	the vast amounts of data that are available to pervasive computing
	applications. Existing contexts and ontologies are either much generalised,
	very application specific, or inflexible. An integrated approach
	is required in which new concepts can be added and related to existing
	ones transparently. This paper describes a novel approach to the
	design of a set of contexts and ontologies for context-aware pervasive
	computing systems. It describes a Query Service, that lies between
	applications and contextual information, which complemented by the
	contexts and ontologies, offers a more powerful query answering service
	to application developers than is currently available.},

@inproceedings{Coyle2007Proposed,
	Abstract = {Location detection systems that use tags are a popular means of determining
	a userOs location. These systems are characterised as requiring the
	user to carry an identity tag that is detected by sensors, which
	typically use some form of triangulation to determine location. Although
	estimates for precision for these systems are published by the respective
	manufacturers the customer experience can vary widely. This paper
	proposes an evaluation framework which will allow different systems
	to be compared more directly. This framework is specifically targeted
	at evaluating the experiences of tagging humans, which can cause
	particular difficulties due to the fact that many tag-based systems
	use communication frequencies that cannot pass easily through the
	human body.},
